If NY Psychics accepts your Account Registration, you will become a "User" having access to the Site and Services only under the policies, terms and conditions below.&nbsp;<br><br>Information you provide is governed by our Privacy Policy.&nbsp;<br>BY CREATING AN ACCOUNT OR OTHERWISE USING THE SITE (AS DEFINED BELOW) AND ANY SERVICES (AS DEFINED BELOW), YOU ARE AGREEING TO BE BOUND BY THIS USER AGREEMENT. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO ACCEPT THIS USER AGREEMENT IN ITS ENTIRETY, YOU SHOULD NOT ACCESS OR USE THE SITE OR SERVICES.&nbsp;<br><br>For convenience, we will refer to nypsychics.com website, "Mail" (any email you send from your User account to another User), "Chat" (any live chats conducted between you and another User), Phone Services and any other content therein as the "Site." We will refer to any advice, information, entertainment and other products or services you may receive from other Users or their listings on the Site as the "Services." All Users, whether they access the Site or provide or receive Services from other Users, will be referred to as "Users."&nbsp;<br><br>The policies, terms and conditions below limit NY Psychics's liability and obligations to you, and NY Psychics &nbsp;may change, suspend or terminate your access to and use of the Site and Services at any time if in NY Psychics's sole discretion you violate any terms and conditions of this User Agreement and NY Psychics 's policies. We urge you to carefully read the following terms and conditions, and all policies referenced below or below on the Site. The following policies and rules are incorporated into this User Agreement by reference and provide additional terms and conditions: Privacy Policy, User Services Rules Policy, Refund Policy, Payment Policy, Feedback Policy, Photo Policy, Chat Policy, Anti-Spam Policy, Sexually-Oriented Content Policy.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>Forum Policy&nbsp;</strong><br>To the extent that there are any conflicts between the terms or conditions in the above policies and this User Agreement, the terms and conditions of the User Agreement shall govern.&nbsp;<br><br>1.<strong> Eligibility to use the Site and Services is limited.&nbsp;</strong><br>The Site and Services are available only to persons who are at least eighteen (18) years old and are otherwise capable of forming legally binding contracts under applicable law. Without limiting the foregoing, the Site and Services are not available to Users who do not have a valid User Agreement in effect, or who NY Psychics has suspended from use of the Site or Services. Also, you shall also not use this Site or Services if your use is prohibited by the laws of the United States or any other country.&nbsp;<br>2. <strong>You consult with Users or provide Services at your own risk.&nbsp;</strong><br>(a) NY Psychics does not evaluate, provide, produce or control the Services, or information or exchanges between Users, in any manner. Although User listings may contain verified credentials, the verification services are provided by third parties. NY Psychics does not itself provide any advice, information or entertainment services or other products or services, nor verify, guarantee or make any representations regarding the credentials, identity or qualifications of any User. Further, NY Psychics does not make editorial or managerial decisions concerning content, nor will NY Psychics be held responsible for any User's failure to comply with laws or regulations concerning the content of listings. NY Psychics provides a technology service that allows Users to share advice, information and other products or Services among themselves. Although&nbsp; NY Psychics helps its Users connect with each other, it does not monitor the advice exchanged, and, as a result, NY Psychics does not control, nor is it responsible for, the truth, accuracy, completeness, safety, timeliness, quality, appropriateness, legality or applicability of anything said or written by Users, including without limitation any information contained in User listings or made available through this Site.&nbsp;<br>The Site is not intended for use as a payment service to exchange goods. NY Psychics is not responsible for the use or exchange of any information, files or goods between Users. You are solely responsible for, and will exercise caution, discretion, common sense and judgment in, using the Site and Services, in evaluating the qualifications of, and statements made by Users in listings or through the User feedback system, and in disclosing personal information to other Users. NY Psychics prohibits any User from requesting that another User disclose personal contact information. If you voluntarily disclose your own personal contact information to another User, you do so at your own risk.&nbsp;<br>Placement of a User in a particular category does not mean that they are qualified in any such area or category. NY Psychics assumes no responsibility for monitoring any User feedback or otherwise policing its Users in any way. If you ever believe that a User has violated the law or is defrauding, threatening or endangering anyone, NY Psychics urges you to immediately contact the law enforcement, welfare services or other appropriate authorities directly for help. In addition, NY Psychics prohibits Users from using the Site or Services to solicit other Users to meet with them in person. If you do meet with other Users, you do so at your own risk.&nbsp;<br>(b) NY Psychics does not refer, endorse, recommend, verify, evaluate or guarantee any advice, information, entertainment services or other products or services provided by Users, or any specific User or Services, and nothing shall be considered as a referral, endorsement, recommendation or guarantee of any User or group of Users by NY Psychics. You must use your judgment to determine whether to initiate, receive and/or discontinue use of the Services. Users who initiate, receive and/or discontinue use of the Services do so entirely at their own risk, and NY Psychics bears no responsibility in this regard. We may monitor or record your live telephone conversations with other Users for operational purposes, including for quality assurance purposes and in furtherance of making certain services available to you. By agreeing to this User Agreement or using the Site, you consent to our monitoring or recording your live telephone conversations as just described. NY Psychics also reserves the right to monitor pre-recorded calls, review Mail and Chat and to contact Users in order to evaluate compliance with the rules and policies set forth in this User Agreement and to take other action as set forth in the Privacy Policy. We urge you to review and understand the Privacy Policy. As part of this User Agreement you are agreeing to the terms and conditions set forth in the Privacy Policy and are obliged to abide by its terms.&nbsp;<br>(c) If you have a dispute with another User, or suffer any harm arising out of or connected with any Services provided by another User, you hereby waive all claims against and release NY Psychics (and its parents, subsidiaries, employees, officers, directors, shareholders, suppliers, joint venturers and agents) from any and all liability for claims, demands, damages (actual and consequential), costs and expenses (including litigation costs and attorneys' fees) of every kind and nature, known and unknown, suspected and unsuspected, disclosed and undisclosed, arising out of or in any way connected with any such other User or his/her Services or with regard to disputes relating thereto. This provision is further supplemented by Appendix A relating to Release of Liability.&nbsp;<br>3. <strong>NY Psychics may suspend or terminate your use of the Site or Services, at any time.&nbsp;</strong><br>(a) NY Psychics reserves right to suspend, terminate, or modify your use of the Site or Services at any time. Any User with an existing Account will be asked to confirm acceptance of the new terms upon his/her first visit to use the Site or Services after posting of the change as a condition of continuing to use the Site or Services. If a returning User does not agree to the new terms, such User may cease using the Site and Services and cancel his/her Account as the User's sole remedy.&nbsp;<br>(b) Without limiting other remedies, NY Psychics may at any time suspend or terminate your right to use the Site or Services without reason as determined by NY Psychics in NY Psychics's absolute and sole discretion. In addition, NY Psychics may notify your bank and/or authorities or take any actions it deems appropriate or as required by law if NY Psychics: (i) suspects that you have failed to comply with any provision of this User Agreement or any policies or rules established by NY Psychics; (ii) is unable to verify or authenticate any billing or payment information you provide to NY Psychics; or (iii) suspects that your actions may be illegal or cause liability, harm or disruption for you, other Users, NY Psychics or the Site. You have the right to cancel your User Agreement at any time by filling out the Customer Support form and selecting "Cancel Account" in the subject line. Any suspension, termination or cancellation will not affect your obligation to pay any amounts due to NY Psychics.&nbsp;<br>4.&nbsp; <strong>NY Psychics's limited role.&nbsp;</strong><br>NY Psychics acts only as an interface to facilitate communications initiated between Users and as a third-party payment network. As a User, you are not an employee, agent or contractor of NY Psychics, and you shall not represent that you are any of the foregoing. You are solely responsible for all equipment necessary to access and use the Site and Services, obtaining any licensing required to provide Services or use the Site, and for reporting and payment of all taxes associated with the use of the Site or provision of Services, including any fees transferred to you by NY Psychics. NY Psychics accepts no responsibility for reporting to law enforcement agencies any threats made by Users to harm themselves or third parties or take any illegal action. Any such responsibility lies with the User alone.&nbsp;<br>5. <strong>You are solely responsible for the use of your User account and agree to the following fee and payment terms:&nbsp;</strong><br>(a) The rates for Services are as set forth in the applicable listing. A "Conversation" refers to any live call or Chat. "Transaction" means any Conversation or pre-recorded call through the Site initiated using your password and User account and any Mail response sent to your Mail account in response to a request for advice, information, entertainment services or other products or services from a User who lists a fee for email responses (each a "Paid Mail"). You hereby authorize NY Psychics to collect fees for each Transaction by debiting your User account immediately upon conclusion of each Transaction, regardless of quality or completeness. Fees for Conversations and pre-recorded calls are calculated based on the per-minute rate listed and the duration of the transaction. NY Psychics reserves the right to offer, from time to time and subject to change at any time, promotions or special offers and may limit eligibility for promotional or special offers. Fees for recorded calls are determined based on the listed fee. Fees for Paid Mail are collected immediately upon acceptance of the Paid Mail, regardless of quality or completeness, by the receiving User and are determined as set forth in the listings. You authorize NY Psychics, directly or through third parties, to make any inquiries we consider necessary to validate your User account and/or listing information. This may include ordering a credit report and performing other credit checks or otherwise verifying the information you provide.&nbsp;<br>(b) You agree to never allow another person access to your User account. You agree to maintain the confidentiality of your password and User account information, and agree that you are responsible for all activities that occur under your User name, password and User account.&nbsp;<br>(c) You are solely responsible for all use made of the Site and Services under your password and User account and agree to pay for all Services purchased using your password and User account information. You agree that NY Psychics is not responsible for any loss that you may incur as a result of any unauthorized person using your User account or password. You agree that NY Psychics may use information provided by you as described in the Privacy Policy.&nbsp;<br>(d) Based on User account use, and other factors identified by NY Psychics in its sole discretion, NY Psychics may verify your credit, identity and/or other background information in order for you to continue using the Site or Services. In such event, you agree to provide NY Psychics with additional information that may be requested; you consent to NY Psychics's disclosure of your personal information to third-party service providers in order to verify your credit, identity and/or other background information; and you authorize NY Psychics to obtain a consumer credit report or information from consumer credit reporting agencies and to verify your identity.&nbsp;<br>6. In using or accessing the Site or Services, you agree to comply with the following:&nbsp;<br>(a) You are solely responsible for the content provided and the content on listings created under your User account.&nbsp;<br>(b) You will not record or otherwise copy or store any live or pre-recorded voice call or Chat that you receive through the Site, including any Paid Mail.

Arbitration Agreement&nbsp;</strong><br>19.1 Agreement to Arbitrate under Federal Arbitration Act - Generally.&nbsp;<br>The parties acknowledge that they are both engaged in transactions involving interstate commerce and that, except as provided in this User Agreement, the Federal Arbitration Act ("FAA") shall govern the interpretation and enforcement of, and all proceedings pursuant to, this User Agreement. The FAA shall apply with full force and effect to the arbitration proceedings, notwithstanding the application of the procedural rules described in Section 19.6 below. To the extent the FAA is either inapplicable, or held not to require arbitration of a particular claim, the laws of the state in which you primarily rendered or received services under this User Agreement that pertain to agreements to arbitrate shall apply. You acknowledge and agree that the substantive laws of the state where you primarily rendered or received services under the User Agreement shall apply to each claim covered by the agreement to arbitrate set forth in this Section 19 ("Arbitration Agreement") without giving effect to principles of conflicts of laws.&nbsp;<br>19.2 Claims Covered by Arbitration Agreement.&nbsp;<br>By entering into this Arbitration Agreement, you agree to arbitrate disputes with any entity or individual, and waive your right to have such disputes resolved by a trial by a jury or judge, arising out of or related to an application for employment, background checks, privacy, an employment relationship, the termination of an employment relationship, trade secrets, unfair competition, compensation policies, practices or amounts, overtime and minimum wage exemptions, calculations or payments, independent contractor, statutory employee or common law employee classifications, suitable seating, wage statements or paystubs, expense reimbursement, meal periods and rest breaks, discipline, promotion and advancement, compensable time and "off-the-clock" work, retaliation, discrimination or harassment, defamation, slander and libel, claims arising under the Fair Credit Reporting Act, Uniform Trade Secrets Act, Civil Rights Act of 1964, Americans With Disabilities Act, Age Discrimination in Employment Act, Family Medical Leave Act, Fair Labor Standards Act, California Labor Code, California Fair Employment and Housing Act, California Family Rights Act, Employee Retirement Income Security Act, Affordable Care Act, Genetic Information Non-Discrimination Act, Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act, state or local statutes or regulations addressing the same or similar subject matters, and all other federal or state legal claims arising out of or relating to this User Agreement.&nbsp;<br>19.3 Claims Not Covered Under Arbitration Agreement.&nbsp;<br>The Arbitration Agreement shall not apply to claims for workers' compensation, unemployment compensation benefits, or any other claims that, as a matter of law, that the parties cannot agree to arbitrate are not subject to, and are excluded from, this Arbitration Agreement. Nothing in this Arbitration Agreement shall be interpreted to prohibit or preclude the filing of complaints with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing, the National Labor Relations Board, or any similar federal, state, or municipal agency.&nbsp;<br>The Arbitration Agreement does not apply to a representative action brought on behalf of others under the Private Attorneys General Act of 2004 ("PAGA"), California Labor Code § 2698, et seq., to the extent that such an action can only be brought by the state or its representatives, where any resulting judgment is binding on the state, and where any alleged monetary penalties largely go to state coffers.&nbsp;<br>The Arbitration Agreement also does not apply to disputes between the parties that may not be subject to pre-dispute arbitration agreement as provided by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Public Law 111-203), or as provided by an Act of Congress.&nbsp;<br>Nothing contained in this Arbitration Agreement shall be construed to prevent or excuse you (individually or in concert with others) or NY Psychics from utilizing NY Psychics's existing internal procedures for resolution of complaints, and this Arbitration Agreement is not intended to be a substitute for the utilization of such procedures.&nbsp;<br>19.4 Waiver of Class and Collective Action Claims.&nbsp;<br>Except as otherwise required by law, the parties expressly intend and agree that: (i) class action and collective action procedures shall neither be asserted nor apply in any arbitration conducted pursuant to the Arbitration Agreement; (ii) neither party will assert, and each party hereby waives, its right to pursue or participate in class or collective action claims against the other in arbitration or any other forum; and (iii) the parties shall only submit their own, individual claims in arbitration and will not seek to represent the interests of any other person.&nbsp;<br>19.5 Waiver of Representative Claims If Allowed By Subsequent Court Decisions.&nbsp;<br>Except as otherwise provided in Sections 19.3 and 19.4, and to the extent permitted by law, (i) you and NY Psychics agree not to bring a representative action on behalf of others in arbitration; and (ii) for any claim brought on a private attorney general basis (i.e., where you are seeking to pursue a claim on behalf of a government entity) both you and NY Psychics agree that any such dispute shall be resolved in arbitration on an individual basis only (i.e., to resolve whether you have been personally aggrieved or subject to any violations of law), and that such an action may not be used to resolve the claims or rights of other individuals in a single or collective proceeding (i.e., to resolve whether other individuals have been aggrieved or subject to any violations of law) ("PAGA Waiver"). Notwithstanding any other provision of this User Agreement, the validity of the PAGA Waiver may be resolved only by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator. If any provision of the PAGA Waiver is found to be unenforceable or unlawful for any reason, (i) the unenforceable provision shall be severed from this Arbitration Agreement; (ii) severance of the unenforceable provision shall have no impact whatsoever on the Arbitration Agreement or the parties' attempt to arbitrate any remaining claims on an individual basis pursuant to the Arbitration Agreement; and (iii) any representative action brought under PAGA on behalf of others must be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not in arbitration.&nbsp;<br>19.6 How Arbitration Proceedings Are Conducted.&nbsp;<br>(a) Starting the Arbitration.&nbsp;<br>All claims in arbitration are subject to the same statutes of limitation that would apply in court. The party bringing the claim must demand arbitration in writing and deliver the written demand by hand or first class mail to the other party within the applicable statute of limitations period. The demand for arbitration shall include identification of the parties, a statement of the legal and factual basis of the claim(s), and a specification of the remedy sought. Any demand for arbitration made to NY Psychics shall be delivered to 182 Howard Street, Suite 826, San Francisco, CA 94105. The arbitrator shall resolve all disputes regarding the timeliness or propriety of the demand for arbitration. A party may apply to a court of competent jurisdiction for temporary or preliminary injunctive relief in connection with an arbitrable controversy, but only upon the ground that the award to which that party may be entitled may be rendered ineffectual without such provisional relief.&nbsp;<br>(b) Selecting the Arbitrator and Location of the Arbitration.&nbsp;<br>You and NY Psychics agree that any arbitration will be administered by Judicial Arbitration &amp; Mediation Services ("JAMS"), pursuant to the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules &amp; Procedures rules ("JAMS Rules"), which are available at http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-streamlined-arbitration/. You and NY Psychics agree that the arbitrator will be selected as provided in the JAMS Rules and that the JAMS Rules regarding discovery shall apply to any arbitration conducted under this Arbitration Agreement. The arbitrator shall decide all discovery disputes. You and NY Psychics also agree that the arbitrator shall have the power to decide any motions brought by any party to the arbitration, including motions for summary judgment and/or adjudication, and motions to dismiss and demurrers. You and NY Psychics further agree that the arbitrator shall issue a written decision on the merits.&nbsp;<br>(c) Challenges to Arbitration.&nbsp;<br>The parties acknowledge that it is NY Psychics's position that the Arbitration Agreement is enforceable in its entirety, and that it can and will oppose any effort to challenge the validity of this Arbitration Agreement. The parties understand and acknowledge that they may bring an action in any court of competent jurisdiction to compel arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement and to confirm, vacate, or enforce an arbitration award on any ground provided in the FAA or applicable state law. The parties further understand that each party shall bear its own attorneys' fees and costs and other expenses of such action.&nbsp;<br>(d) Paying for the Arbitration.&nbsp;<br>You understand that the NY Psychics will pay for all costs and fees unique to the arbitration process. Otherwise, each party is responsible for paying its own attorneys' fees, costs, and any other expenses incurred in connection with the arbitration. However, if either party prevails on a claim that affords the prevailing party attorneys' fees and/or costs pursuant to applicable state law, statute, or contract, the arbitrator may award reasonable attorneys' fees and/or costs to the prevailing party to the extent allowed by law. The arbitrator shall resolve any dispute as to the reasonableness of any fee or cost.&nbsp;<br>(e) Substantive Law Applied by Arbitrator.&nbsp;<br>As set forth in Section 19.1 above, the parties agree that the arbitrator shall apply the substantive law of the state in which you primarily rendered or received services under this User Agreement to any dispute or claim, without reference to rules of conflict of laws. The location of the arbitration proceeding shall be no more than 45 miles from the place where you last rendered or received services under this User Agreement, unless each party to the arbitration agrees in writing otherwise. The parties agree that the arbitrator shall also have the power to award any remedies available under applicable state law.&nbsp;<br>(f) The Arbitration Hearing and Award.&nbsp;<br>The arbitrator must follow applicable law and may award any party any remedy to which that party is entitled under applicable law, but such remedies shall be limited to those that would be available to a party in his or her individual capacity in a court of law for the claims presented to and decided by the arbitrator, and no remedies that otherwise would be available to an individual in a court of law will be forfeited by virtue of this Arbitration Agreement. The arbitrator's decision shall be final and binding upon the parties, must be in writing, and must contain the arbitrator's reasoning. Judgment may be entered on the arbitrator's decision in any court having jurisdiction.&nbsp;<br>19.7 Opting Out of the Arbitration Agreement.&nbsp;<br>(a) Arbitration is not a mandatory condition of your contractual relationship with NY Psychics. If you do not want to be subject to this Arbitration Agreement, you may opt out of this Arbitration Agreement by notifying NY Psychics in writing of your desire to opt out of this Arbitration Agreement, either by (1) sending, within 30 days of the date this User Agreement is executed by you, electronic mail to privacy@NY Psychics.com stating your name and intent to opt out of the Arbitration Agreement or (2) by sending a letter by U.S. Mail, or by any nationally recognized delivery service (e.g., UPS, Federal Express, etc.), or by hand delivery to: NY Psychics, 182 Howard Street, Suite 826, San Francisco, CA 94105.&nbsp;<br>In order to be effective, the letter under option (2) must clearly indicate your intent to opt out of this Arbitration Agreement, and must be dated and signed.

What you write can be read by other Users, and in most cases, you cannot go back and edit your remarks - they become a permanent part of that User's record.

Under applicable laws, including the Communications Decency Act, NY Psychics is not legally responsible for the feedback that Users post on its Site, even if that feedback is defamatory.
